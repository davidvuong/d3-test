# d3-test

**Welcome to d3-test!**

This repository contains code examples from https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar, an introductory tutorial on D3. There's nothing special about this repository and is only used as a quick reference if I forgot anything simple and don't want to read the documentation.

The code here is written using the latest version of D3 (as of 2016-06-27), v4.rc2.
